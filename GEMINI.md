# Project Summary (Generated by Gemini CLI)

This document summarizes the current state and key changes made to the `hello_springboot` project.

## Project Overview
The project has been transformed into a Spring Boot application acting as a Certificate Authority (CA) server. It can issue and manage X.509 certificates, and also sign JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) using the generated certificates' private keys.

Key responsibilities are separated into distinct controllers:
*   `CertificateController`: Handles all certificate management operations (generation, listing, deletion).
*   `JwtSigningController`: Dedicated to signing JWTs.
*   `JwtHistoryController`: Manages the history of JWT signing operations.
*   `JwtSchemaController`: Manages JSON schemas for claim validation.

Automated integration tests using `MockMvc` have been implemented in `ApplicationTests.java` to ensure the reliability of the main API workflows.

## Key Configurations and Features

*   **Spring Boot Version:** 3.5.3
*   **Java Version:** 22
*   **Main Package:** `org.license`
*   **Server Port:** 18080 (configured in `src/main/resources/application.properties`)
*   **Services:** `CaService`, `JwtSchemaService`, `JwtSigningService` (formerly `JwtCertificateService`)
*   **Database Driver:** `org.xerial:sqlite-jdbc` (SQLite JDBC Driver)

### CA Functionality
*   **CA KeyStore:** `certs/ca.jks`
    *   Contains the CA certificate and private key.
    *   The application monitors this file for changes and reloads the CA automatically.
    *   **Note:** The `ca.jks` file must be manually generated using `keytool` as instructed during the setup.
*   **Generated Certificates KeyStore:** `certs/generated.jks`
    *   Stores all newly generated certificates and their corresponding private keys in JKS format.
    *   This KeyStore is created if it doesn't exist and is automatically saved upon certificate generation or deletion.

### Database Configuration
*   **Type:** SQLite
*   **File:** `db/history.db` (configured in `src/main/resources/application.properties`)
*   **JPA DDL Auto:** `update` (configured in `src/main/resources/application.properties`)

### REST API Endpoints

*   **GET `/hi`**: Returns "Hello World". (Initial test endpoint)

#### Certificate Management (`CertificateController`)

*   **GET `/certificates`**: Lists all certificates currently stored in `certs/generated.jks`.
*   **POST `/certificates/generate`**: Generates a new certificate and its private key, storing them in `certs/generated.jks`.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `commonName` (String, required): The common name for the new certificate.
        *   `validityDays` (long, optional, default: 365): The validity period in days.
*   **DELETE `/certificates/{commonName}`**: Deletes a certificate and its private key from `certs/generated.jks` based on the provided `commonName`.
*   **GET `/certificates/ca-certificate/pem`**: Returns the CA's public key certificate in X.509/PEM format.
*   **GET `/certificates/{commonName}/pem`**: Returns a generated certificate in X.509/PEM format based on the provided `commonName`.

#### JWT Signing (`JwtSigningController`)

*   **POST `/jwt/sign`**: Signs a set of JSON claims with the private key of a specified certificate and returns a complete JWS token. Upon execution, a record of the signing attempt (both successful and failed) is saved to the database and can be retrieved via the `/history` endpoint.
    *   **Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
          "commonName": "your-certificate-common-name",
          "claims": {
            "sub": "1234567890",
            "name": "John Doe",
            "iat": 1516239022
          }
        }
        ```

#### Signing History (`JwtHistoryController`)

*   **GET `/history`**: Lists all JWT signing history records.
*   **POST `/history`**: Adds a new JWT signing history record.
    *   **Request Body:** `JwtSignHistory` object.
*   **DELETE `/history/{id}`**: Deletes a signing history record by its ID.

#### Schema Management (`JwtSchemaController`)

*   **POST `/schemas/{schemaName}`**: Stores a JSON schema definition for claims validation.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `schemaName` (String, required): The name to assign to the schema.
    *   **Request Body:** Raw JSON schema content.
*   **GET `/schemas`**: Lists all stored JSON schema names.
*   **GET `/schemas/{schemaName}`**: Retrieves a stored JSON schema definition.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `schemaName` (String, required): The name of the schema to retrieve.
*   **DELETE `/schemas/{schemaName}`**: Deletes a stored JSON schema definition.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `schemaName` (String, required): The name of the schema to delete.

## Utility Scripts

*   **`decode_jwt.py`**: A Python 3 script to decode a JWT string and display its header and payload in a readable JSON format.
    *   **Usage:** `python3 decode_jwt.py <jwt_string>`

## How to Run

1.  **Ensure `ca.jks` exists:** Make sure you have generated the `ca.jks` file in the `certs/` directory using the `keytool` command provided during the setup.
2.  **Build the Spring Boot project:**
    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean build
    ```
3.  **Run the Spring Boot application (Backend):**
    ```bash
    ./gradlew bootRun &
    ```
    (The `&` runs it in the background. You can check logs in `bootRun.log`.)
4.  **Install Next.js frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```
5.  **Run the Next.js frontend application:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    (This will typically run on `http://localhost:3000`)
