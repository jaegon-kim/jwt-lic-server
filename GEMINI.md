# Project Summary (Generated by Gemini CLI)

This document summarizes the current state and key changes made to the `hello_springboot` project.

## Project Overview
The project has been transformed into a Spring Boot application acting as a Certificate Authority (CA) server. It can issue and manage X.509 certificates.

## Key Configurations and Features

*   **Spring Boot Version:** 3.5.3 (latest stable as of 2025-07-13)
*   **Java Version:** 22
*   **Main Package:** `org.license`
*   **Server Port:** 18080 (configured in `src/main/resources/application.properties`)

### CA Functionality
*   **CA KeyStore:** `certs/ca.jks`
    *   Contains the CA certificate and private key.
    *   The application monitors this file for changes and reloads the CA automatically.
    *   **Note:** The `ca.jks` file must be manually generated using `keytool` as instructed during the setup.
*   **Generated Certificates KeyStore:** `certs/generated.jks`
    *   Stores all newly generated certificates and their corresponding private keys in JKS format.
    *   This KeyStore is created if it doesn't exist and is automatically saved upon certificate generation or deletion.

### REST API Endpoints

*   **GET `/hi`**: Returns "Hello World". (Initial test endpoint)
*   **GET `/certificates`**: Lists all certificates currently stored in `certs/generated.jks`.
*   **POST `/certificates/generate`**: Generates a new certificate and its private key, storing them in `certs/generated.jks`.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `commonName` (String, required): The common name for the new certificate.
        *   `validityDays` (long, optional, default: 365): The validity period in days.
*   **DELETE `/certificates/{commonName}`**: Deletes a certificate and its private key from `certs/generated.jks` based on the provided `commonName`.

## How to Run

1.  **Ensure `ca.jks` exists:** Make sure you have generated the `ca.jks` file in the `certs/` directory using the `keytool` command provided during the setup.
2.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean build
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    ./gradlew bootRun &
    ```
    (The `&` runs it in the background. You can check logs in `bootRun.log`.)

## Next Steps / Resuming Work
